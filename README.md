# Intracerebral Hemorrhage study

This repo contains for two papers.
1. Machine Learningâ€“Based Prediction for In-Hospital Mortality After Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Real-World Clinical and Image Data - [paper link](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.036447)
2. Performance of Multimodal Prediction Models for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Outcomes Using Real-World Data (under review)

The main files to run are:
`main_train.py` (for fine-tuning), `main_pretrain.py` (for pre-training)

For access to the data used for pre-training in the papers, please refer to:
